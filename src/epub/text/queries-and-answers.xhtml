			<blockquote>
				<p>Can you inform me where I can buy an interest in a newspaper of some kind? I have some money and would be glad to invest it in something of the sort, if someone would allow me to put in my capital against his experience.</p>

				<p>What does an <abbr epub:type="z3998:initialism">F.F.V.</abbr> mean?</p>
				<p epub:type="z3998:signature">Ignorant.</p>
			</blockquote>
			<p>What does he mean by what? If he takes you by the arm and tells you how much you are like a brother of his in Richmond, he means Feel For Your Vest, for he wants to borrow a five. If he holds his head high and don’t speak to you on the street he means that he already owes you ten and is Following a Fresh Victim.</p>
