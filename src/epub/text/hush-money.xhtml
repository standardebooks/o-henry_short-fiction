			<h2 epub:type="title">Hush Money</h2>
			<p>He was a great practical joker, and never lost a chance to get a good one on somebody. A few days ago he stopped a friend on Main Street and said, confidentially:</p>
			<p>“I never would have believed it, but I believe it my duty to make it known. <abbr epub:type="z3998:name-title">Mr.</abbr> ⸻, the alderman for our ward, has been taking hush money.”</p>
			<p>“Impossible!” said his friend.</p>
			<p>“I tell you, it’s true, for I overheard the conversation and actually saw it handed over to him, and he took the money and put it in his pocket.”</p>
			<p>Then he went on without explaining any further, and the thing got talked around considerably for a day or two.</p>
			<p>He forgot all about it until one day he met the alderman and suffered from the encounter to the extent of two black eyes and a coat split up the back.</p>
			<p>And then he had to go all round and explain that what he meant was that he had seen the alderman’s wife give him a dime to buy some paregoric for the baby.</p>
