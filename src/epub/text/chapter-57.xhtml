			<h2 epub:type="title">A Universal Favorite</h2>
			<p>The most popular and best loved young lady in the United States is Miss Annie Williams of Philadelphia. Her picture is possessed by more men, and is more eagerly sought after than that of Lillian Russell, <abbr>Mrs.</abbr> Langtry, or any other famous beauty. There is more demand for her pictures than for the counterfeit presentments of all the famous men and women in the world combined. And yet she is a modest, charming, and rather retiring young lady, with a face less beautiful than of a clear and classic outline.</p>
			<p>Miss Williams is soon to be married, but it is expected that the struggle for her pictures will go on as usual.</p>
			<p>She is the lady the profile of whose face served as the model for the head of Liberty on our silver dollar.</p>
