			<h2 epub:type="title">No Time to Lose</h2>
			<p>A young Houston mother rushed into die house the other day in the utmost excitement, calling out to her mother to put an iron on the fire as quick as possible.</p>
			<p>“What is the matter?” asked the old lady.</p>
			<p>“A dog has just bitten Tommy, and I am afraid it was mad. Oh, hurry up, mother; be as quick as you can!”</p>
			<p>“Are you going to try to cauterize the wound?”</p>
			<p>“No⁠—I’ve got to iron that blue skirt before I can wear it to go after the doctor. Do be in a hurry.”</p>
